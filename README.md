# r2SCAN-U-benchmarking

This repository contains the density functional theory calculated data of all transition metal oxides (TMOs) considered as part of the research paper, that is published on the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, at this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00030">DoI</a>. An older version of the manuscript is also available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00535">arXiv</a>. 

The goal of the research project was to evaluate the computational performance and numerical efficiency of restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed (r<sup>2</sup>SCAN) exchange-correlation functional on TMOs. We have also evaluated optimal Hubbard <i>U</i> corrections that can be used with the r<sup>2</sup>SCAN functional to minimize self interaction errors and verified the transferability of such <i>U</i> values.

Each functional folder has designed folders for each transition metal system, within which there are individual folders for individual TMOs. Each TMO folder has key output files (and a few input files as well) from density functional theory calculations performed for a given compound. We performed structure relaxations and/or density of states (DOS) for each structure considered.

In case you use any of the data here, we would appreciate a citation to our publication at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00030">DoI</a>.
