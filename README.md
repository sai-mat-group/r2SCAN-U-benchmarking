# r2SCAN-U-benchmarking

This repository contains the density functional theory calculated data of all transition metal oxides (TMOs) considered as part of the research manuscript, that is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00535">arXiv</a>. The manuscript is under review and we will update this README page with a DoI once it is published.

The goal of the research project was to evaluate the computational performance and numerical efficiency of restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed (r<sup>2</sup>SCAN) exchange-correlation functional on TMOs. We have also evaluated optimal Hubbard <i>U</i> corrections that can be used with the r<sup>2</sup>SCAN functional to minimize self interaction errors and verified the transferability of such <i>U</i> values.

Each functional folder has designed folders for each transition metal system, within which there are individual folders for individual TMOs. Each TMO folder has key output files (and a few input files as well) from density functional theory calculations performed for a given compound. We performed structure relaxations and/or density of states (DOS) for each structure considered.
